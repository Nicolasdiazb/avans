          at generating knowledge across diverse domains is crucial. Educational
          institutions, including universities and vocational centers, are undergoing
          transformations to equip individuals with the necessary skills. These adaptations
          focus on hands-on learning experiences, nurturing students'' practical
          competencies and professional identities.

          Learning from real-life

          Hybrid
          learning emerges as a key strategy, blending traditional educational methods
          with real-world, challenging tasks. This approach encompasses various types
          of knowledge, emphasizing the integration of education, research, and professional
          practice. Scientific literature refers to this as a ''hybrid learning configuration,''
          emphasizing the interconnectedness of these elements. This holistic approach
          envisions a collaborative space where education, research, and business
          sectors converge.

          Diversity in knowledge

          Diversity
          in knowledge is a cornerstone of this process, with a blend of scientific
          and practical insights contributing to system knowledge (understanding
          the current reality), goal knowledge (envisioning the desired outcome),
          and transformational knowledge (transitioning from system to goal knowledge).
          Participants bring varied knowledge types, derived from their experiences
          or lifestyles.

          Boundary crossing

          In this context,
          social practice signifies a hybrid environment mirroring the characteristics
          of participating organizations, including education, research, and the
          business sector. Addressing complex issues sourced from professional practice
          or society, this collaborative effort involves co-creating knowledge. Cross-boundary
          collaboration becomes essential, leveraging diverse perspectives, disciplines,
          and sectors introduced by partners. This inclusive strategy ensures a comprehensive
          and enriched learning experience, reflecting the multifaceted demands of
          our dynamic society.

      - textString: "Community building in a transdisciplinary project should be
          understood in two ways: on the one hand, it is essential to create a community
          inside your project teams, once the team is established. This community
          smoothens the mutual relations to create understanding, respect and the
          mutual trust to embark on an adventure towards a not yet determined outcome.
          At other hand, engaging with external networks can significantly enhance
          the relevance, innovative capabilities and finally outreach of your transdisciplinary
          project. Collaborating with local, national, or international partners
          provides valuable insights and expertise, acting as consultants or potential
          funders for your programs. Initiating connections with local actors fosters
          strong ties with the community, presenting unique challenges and opportunities
          to test lab results in real-life scenarios.\r\nSeveral online toolkits
          facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration with external partners. First,
          when you approach a future collaboration as a single individual, you might
          have to search for parters. A workshop \u2018mapping your stakeholders\u2019
          (M. Craps) can act as a starting point in this process.\r\nWhen starting
          to know each other and create a team-community, the Shape-id Toolkit (https://www.shapeidtoolkit.eu/
          ) offers pathways for engaging with societal partners, while other external
          networks like STEAM+(https://www.steamtalent.eu/), Copernicus Alliance
          (https://www.copernicus-alliance.org/) , Learning Planet Alliance (https://www.learning-planet.org/),
          Lifelong Learning Platform (https://www.lllplatform.eu/ ) and ITD Alliance

        - textString: "Format\r\nTo establish a transdisciplinary education structure,
            the initial step involves navigating through various available formats,
            taking into account factors such as student schedules, educational requirements,
            institutional possibilities, and innovative approaches across different
            faculties. The decision-making process should be driven by the desired
            outcomes for students and other learners, alongside the available support.\r\nIntra-
            or extracurricular \r\nThe first decision is whether the educational
            program is extra- or intracurricular. For instance, extracurricular options
            include summer- or winterschool, involving short intensive courses outside
            the academic year, or an honors program that runs throughout the year
            alongside regular classes to broaden the learning program. Intra-curricular
            possibilities encompass regular classes, modules, minors, or a graduation
            project. Living labs and hackathons can be both extra- and intracurricular.\r\nTime
            commitment\r\nIt is essential for the chosen format to align with the
            preferences of participants around the table, such as students, researchers,
            teachers, and societal partners. Consideration should be given to whether
            all participants will be present simultaneously, potentially fostering
            a learning community with equality, or if there will be variations in
            the time commitment of different participants, such as researchers or
            societal partners. Shorter periods of time with all participants may
            facilitate a more equitable learning community, while longer stretches
            allow for a more in-depth exploration of multiple competencies.\r\nCompulsory
            or elective\r\nThe next consideration is whether the program will be
            compulsory or elective. Opting for an elective approach has the advantage
            of higher student and participant motivation. This inclusivity ensures
            the active involvement of researchers, students, teachers, and societal
            partners. Implementing admission requirements can further contribute
            to attracting the desired student profile. However, transdisciplinary
            education can be beneficial for all students, therefore, it could be
            a part of a compulsory class or program to encourage all students to
            learn to collaborate and meet different perspectives.\r\n"

            may take more time before teams delve into their chosen challenge, requiring
            initial deliberation on the specific aspect of the wicked problem to
            address collectively.\r\n\u2022\tMay create smaller impact as projects
            are less interconnected.\r\n\u2022\tLocal community issues are attractive
            and generate more impact\r\nLocal communities\r\nLocal community issues,
            for instance, can enhance the attractiveness of a challenge. Addressing
            a challenge with local impact allows students to witness the tangible
            results of their efforts, fostering motivation and a sense of ownership.
            Research generates more impact if the project is not only relevant in
            general, but for the specific local practice (Groothuijsen, 2021). Tackling
            a local challenge also empowers students to take initiative and implement
            their vision, promoting a sense of responsibility. Furthermore, choosing
            a local challenge facilitates student engagement, as it connects them
            with a readily available local network and encourages support from local
            authorities for the innovation lab.\r\n"

        - textString: 'Learning environment

            An important consideration
            is the location of the transdisciplinary learning environment. Various
            options exist, including organizing it on the school campus, at an external
            venue, online, or adopting a hybrid approach that combines both on- and
            offline elements. Conducting the program on campus has the advantage
            of well-equipped rooms with materials for work, learning, and collaboration,
            including projectors, screens, tables, chairs, and Wi-Fi. Additionally,
            the on-campus setting is accessible and familiar to participants, potentially
            reducing barriers to participation.

            External location

            Choosing
            an external location can be inspiring, offering existing wicked problems
            for participants to tackle. This setting becomes a space for experimentation,
            research, and collaboration, often involving societal partners already
            engaged in the location where the learning environment occurs. Moreover,
            it breaks the routine of a familiar environment, creating a neutral space
            where each participant can engage on an equal footing.

            Context

            Considering
            the context is crucial. What kind of environment do you want to create
            with the participants? Is it meant to be informal, practical, or social?
            The choice depends on the wicked problem being addressed. For instance,
            at Avans Hogeschool, Helio''s (Hybrid External Learning and Innovation
            environments) extend beyond the classroom. De Kleine Aarde, a food garden,
            focuses on issues related to food transition, biodiversity, and soil.
            Meanwhile, WijWest, a neighbour centre, addresses social issues like
            neighbourhood loneliness or youth criminality.

            Therefore,
            selecting the environment and context should align with the wicked problem
            being addressed, the involved parties, and the program format.

            the program in the institute. It is important to have the support of
            the organization. Since transdisciplinary education requires experimentation
            space it is important to have sufficient time from all partners and money
            to make sure that the quality of learning stays high. A common problem
            on this point is that transdisciplinary education is often a pilot project
            that is not embedded in the organization yet. Therefore, mostly teachers
            invest a lot of their time to make this program happen with subsidy for
            innovative learning programs. However, to continue the program is frequently
            a challenge.\r\nHelp of the institution\r\nTherefore, it is important
            to involve the institute into the development of the program and provide

            are a few possibilities to divide time and resources, found in multiple
            interesting practices. Resources could come from multiple sources. For
            example, the transdisciplinary program could be connected with a research
            group who has the finances to spend time to join a transdisciplinary
            program and can use the results for their own research. Also, societal
            partners could provide a location for the students and invest time to
            interact with them. \r"

            objectives extend beyond just students; educators, researchers, and societal
            partners are also integral learners. Establishing a conducive learning
            environment where all participants can contribute to and learn is paramount.
            The exploration of wicked problems opens avenues for diverse learning
            goals, categorized into three key aspects:\r\n\u2022\t knowledge acquisition,\r\n\u2022\taction-oriented
            outcomes, \r\n\u2022\tand the development of intrinsic values,\r\nessentially
            encompassing the realms of the head, hands, and heart (Smeers et al.).
            Notably, the emphasis is often placed on the process itself rather than
            the end result (Veltman et al., 2021). In your transdisciplinary project
            you can incorporate these three forms of learning goals.\r\nKnowledge
            acquisition\r\n \r\nIn transdisciplinary education you create knowledge
            for society, practice, education and science. You create knowledge together
            by sharing, discovering, working and researching together, by applying
            knowledge in new situations. l Knowledge creation within the transdisciplinary
            framework is dynamic, shaped by the wicked problem at hand and the collaborative
            efforts of the transdisciplinary team. Drawing from multiple disciplines
            and engaging with societal partners, including organizations and civilians,
            broadens the nature of knowledge. The scale of knowledge encompasses
            critical thinking, systemic and holistic thinking, long-term orientation,
            visioning, understanding complexity, and sensemaking, wherein the head
            plays a pivotal role.\r\nDiscuss with your transdisciplinary group what
            kind of knowledge you want to create together.\r\nAction-oriented outcomes\r\n
            \r\nIn transdisciplinary projects you work on concrete projects that
            contribute to societal issues. You develop new things together. Action
            is a fundamental component of the learning process, emphasizing collaborative
            efforts to address real wicked problems. This approach directs the learning
            process towards active outcomes with potential societal impact. Embracing
            an action-oriented mentality instils courage, creativity, perseverance,
            resilience, and optimism. Interacting with actual stakeholders facing
            the problem fosters collaborative skills such as effective communication
            and co-creation. This proactive approach not only prepares students for
            collaborations beyond the academic setting but also motivates other stakeholders
            to participate in the change-making process, contributing to societal
            impact, where the hands play a major role.\r\nDiscuss with your transdisciplinary
            group what kind of products you want to develop.\r\nDevelopment of intrinsic
            values\r\n \r\nFinally, transdisciplinary projects contribute to everyone's
            self-development as a human. The final learning goal revolves around
            willingness, reflecting inner development goals encompassing being, thinking,
            relating, collaborating, and acting. This transformative approach facilitates
            a profound change within the participant, aligning with essential frameworks
            for transformative skills for sustainable development, echoing the principles
            of the sustainable development goals. This internalized motivation, driven
            from within, underscores the critical role of the heart in the learning
            process. The Inner Development Goals \u2013 also discussed in the video
            on top of this page \u2013 relate to this learning process. \r"

            is a place for students and other participants to develop crucial learning
            competences for the future. \r\nLearn through collaboration \r\nThe learning
            is focused on wicked problems, in which a learning team is collaborating
            to act upon the problem. In that sense, a major part of the learning
            is collaborating to find an outcome of the wicked problem. Thus, the
            focus is mainly on researching, acting and reflecting. To solve a problem,
            we come to three phases. \r\n\u2022\tThe first one is to explore the
            problem, \r\n\u2022\tthen to define the problem \r\n\u2022\tand finally,
            to solve the problem.\r\nThis process will be repeated in an iterative
            way to come closer to a possible outcome (praktijkgids transdisciplinair
            leren). Through the process participants learn about the problem, the
            necessary knowledge to solve the problem and the different perspectives
            from multiple participants on the problem.\r\nFormal learning\r\nThere
            is also space for formal learning (see the examples of De Kleine Aarde,
            later on in the TRAIL) in which participants are trained in certain skills
            and gain knowledge from experts. Possibilities on these learning activities
            are workshops about wicked problems, system thinking, future thinking
            or stakeholder mapping. Additionally, reflection sessions should be implemented
            regularly.  Activities such as visits to certain companies or sites that
            are related to the wicked problem both create a connection between the
            participants and give an insight into the wicked problem. A collaboration
            of different universities created a toolbox for teachers with multiple
            learning activities connected to the Inner Development Goals. \r\n\r\nIntense
            Learning activities\r\n\r\nLiterature shows that especially at the beginning

            collaboratively in a safe and equal environment (Fam et al., 2018). \r\n"

            ~ T.S. Eliot\r\nA transdisciplinary learning environment is learner driven
            and allows participants to experience and experiment with a transdisciplinary
            process. Where the participants will end up at the end cannot be completely
            defined because they have the space and freedom to try different things.
            Some ideas will work, and others will not, but through experimentation
            creativity is engaged.\r\nIterative process\r\nLearning iteratively is
            how we learn naturally. In a transdisciplinary approach, when handling
            wicked problems, learning iteratively is the only way forward. Because
            transdisciplinary research deals with complex and unsolvable (wicked)
            problems, every attempt to answer such an issue is prone to bringing
            about new or unforeseen consequences. Its complexity relates to many
            diverging factors. It concerns different and often conflicting desires
            from stakeholders and appears to evolve organically together with whatever
            approach is decided upon, generating new issues that need to be tackled.
            Therefore, the problem needs to be regularly revisited, re-analysed,
            re-framed and the plan of action rethought in iterative processes.\r\nThe
            iterative process can be confusing and frustrating because a big part
            of the learning process is about the un-known. This is for all participants,
            both students, teachers, researchers and societal partners. \r\nLearning
            by doing\r\nTo learn more about the challenge and develop the transversal
            skills needed to tackle real life issues, the program should guide participants
            through one or two iterations. The approach to addressing wicked problems
            fits closely to the human learning process as described by Kolb\u2019s
            (2014) theory of experiential learning (Learning by Doing). We learn
            a lot by continuously establishing thoughts, putting those ideas into
            action and then reflecting upon them. That reflection leads to deeper
            insights and new ideas, which can then be put into action again and reflected
